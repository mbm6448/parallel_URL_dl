## Features

- Command-line interface for flexible usage.

- Downloads large files in chunks, minimizing memory usage.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

- Python (version 3.6 or newer)
- `requests` library 

Install the required library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbm6448/parallel_URL_dl.git
cd parallel_URL_dl
```

2. Create a file with your desired name (e.g., `urls.txt`). Populate it with URLs â€” one URL per line.

3. Run the script with:

```bash
python downloader.py urls.txt
```

For specifying the number of threads:

```bash
python downloader.py urls.txt --threads 10
```

The downloaded files will be saved in the same directory using their original filenames from the URLs.
